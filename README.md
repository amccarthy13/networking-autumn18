# Networks and Distributed Systems, UChicago Autumn 2018

These programs are from my networks and distributed systems course at the University of Chicago.  Each project has a README that explains what it does, but put simply, the first project is a messaging application that can act as a client or server (using TCP or UDP connections) and the second project is a web crawler that was desinged to retrieve a set of files from a university run website.
